# Demand Forecast Predictor

## Background

Since the legalization of recreational marijuana in November 2016, recreational marijuana has been a booming industry in the state of California. From the fiscal year of 2020 - 2021 alone, nearly a billion dollars of tax revenue was generated in sales, despite the vast majority of the industry remaining underground. As in any field of business, brands need to be able to accurately predict future sales based on time, and the products they put out, especially in a new and budding market. Therefore, the company Cookies has assigned you to predict sales for their upcoming new products. Given four disparate large data sheets, try to accurately predict and make informed business suggestions based on the outcome!

## Technologies, Libraries, and APIs

This project was made in Python and Jupyter Notebook. It involves the use of NumPy, Scikit-Learn, MatPlotLib, and Pandas. The majority of the machine learning algorithms and methods such as linear regression, polynomial regression, principal component analysis, gradient boosting, and cross validation were trained and tested via Sklearn. Data was visualized via MatPlotLib and the entire project is written on Jupyter Notebooks.
